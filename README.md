# Explanation of architecture

![Architecture Diagram](./Images/arc.jpg)


# If you had more time, what would you like to improve?

- Use DataTables like `https://react-table.js.org/#/story/readme` for Paginaltion and Performance (Lazy Loading)
- Did not use the table library in this project
- If the scope of project is big and there would be a lot of flow of state, would implement redux 
- Write test cases that covers more scenarios 

# To Run Tests 

- `npm run test` to run the App test press `a` to run all tests 


```
Notes :
- Used JSON file as there was `CORS` error from the `https://tender-mclean-00a2bd.netlify.com/web/movies.json`
- Could have used datatables or added pagination did not do because it was an evaluation task .
- api should support pagination for better performace
